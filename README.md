# 🦠 Signature-Based Antivirus in MATLAB

Welcome to the **Signature-Based Antivirus in MATLAB** project! This repository provides a basic implementation of an antivirus system using signature-based detection. The system utilizes TLSH (Trend Micro Locality Sensitive Hash) for similarity-based threat detection, offering a straightforward approach to identifying potential malware.

## 🌟 Features

- **Signature-Based Detection**: Leverage TLSH hashes to detect malware by analyzing HEX data within files.
- **Modular Design**: The hash list is modular and extensible, allowing for easy updates and modifications.
- **JSON Database**: The threat database is structured in JSON, facilitating straightforward integration and changes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sadboynio/matlab-antivirus-signature-based.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project in MATLAB**: 
   Navigate to the cloned directory and open the project in MATLAB.

3. **Provide Folder Path**: 
   Input the folder path you wish to scan for potential threats.

4. **Add Your Signatures**: 
   Enhance detection capabilities by adding your own TLSH or hex signatures.

> **Note**: Both TLSH and hex detection rely on the same signature list. You can modify or replace this list as needed.

## ⚙️ TLSH Tool Installation

This project requires the TLSH tool from Trend Micro. To install TLSH, execute the following commands:

```bash
wget https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh/archive/master.zip -O master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd tlsh-master
./make.sh
```

This will download, unzip, and compile the TLSH tool, making it ready for use in your antivirus system.

## 🦠 Sample Malware Signatures

For testing purposes, you can utilize sample malware signatures included in this repository. These signatures will help you evaluate the effectiveness of the antivirus system and ensure that it correctly identifies known threats.

## 🛠️ Usage Instructions

Once you have set up the project and installed TLSH, you can start scanning files for potential malware. Follow these steps:

1. **Launch MATLAB**: Open the MATLAB application.
2. **Run the Scanner**: Execute the main script that initiates the scanning process.
3. **Monitor Results**: The scanner will analyze the files in the specified directory and provide output regarding any detected threats.

You can customize the scanning process by adjusting the parameters in the configuration file.
